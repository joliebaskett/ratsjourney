    <h3>A Rat's Journey</h3>
    <p>There was a rat who heard of a magical object that would lead them to their purpose in life. 
    It was called the Kumquat of Truth. </p>
    
    <p>No one knew where to find the Kumquat of Truth but the rat was determined to find it. The rat felt that once it was found it would answer cure all of their uncertainty. </p>
    
    <p>The rat had never left their forest home and didn't know what other worlds awaited them, but that didn't stop the rat. They were determined to find the elusive kumquat, no matter what waited outside.</p>
    
    <p> Hence begins a Rat's Journey.</p>
